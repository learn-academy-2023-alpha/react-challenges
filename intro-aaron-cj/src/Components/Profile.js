      <h3>Aaron</h3>
      <p>
        Aaron is trying really hard to figure this out. He is much better at
        writing unneccessary, in-depth descriptions of other people. He could
        probably also get you to spend at least 50% of your checking account to
        learn information from others. Don't believe me, let me tell you about
        CJ.
      </p>
      <h3>CJ</h3>
      <p>
        You may ask yourself upon first meeting CJ, how on earth did he manage
        to amass such an astounding collection of memorabilia. Well, he will
        tell you, if you first SMASH that like button, DESTROY the notification
        bell, and punch your computer screen directly into the sun. If you can't
        get it that far, you aren't ready for this knowledge...
